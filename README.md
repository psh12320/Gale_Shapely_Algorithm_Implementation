# Implementation of the Gale Shapely Algorithm

This program is simple implementation of this algorithm to create matches between 2 groups of 5 people where all 10 people have preferences for the person they would like to be matched with.

The list ***s*** contains 5 people who are given indexes 1 to 5.

The list ***p*** contains 5 people who are given indexes 1 to 5 as well.

The lists ***srankings*** and ***prankings*** contain the preferences each person in s and p have given on who they would like to be matched with.

The rest of the program guides the reader on how the matching process works.
